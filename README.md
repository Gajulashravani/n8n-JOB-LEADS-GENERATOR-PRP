# n8n-JOB-LEADS-GENERATOR-PRP
This n8n workflow scrapes job leads using user-provided inputs like job title and location. It automatically saves the results to a Google Sheet and sends a summary of the new listings to the user's email. You need to configure your own credentials for the Adzuna API, Google Sheets, and Gmail.
